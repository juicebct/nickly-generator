- **Design:**

  The design was created by me in **Figma**, featuring **prototyping** and reusable **components** for consistent UI/UX. The website was developed based on this design to maintain visual and functional accuracy.

## Future plans

  The project will continue to be maintained and improved. At the moment it is planned to implement:

  - Adding more language to the site interface.
  - Adding more parameters for generation: new nationalities, new first and last names for existing ones.

  *The list will be added and updated.*
  *You can suggest your idea for updating in Discussions.*
